## Introduction

What is Solana:

- [The Solana Programming Model](https://www.helius.dev/blog/the-solana-programming-model-an-introduction-to-developing-on-solana) - The mindset for Solana development.

## Getting Started

The no-fluff starter:

- [The Solana Cookbook](https://solanacookbook.com/) - Start building on Solana fast
- [Solana Playground](https://playground.solana.com/) - An in-browser IDE for writing, deploying, and testing Solana programs.
- [Solana Developer Resources](https://solana.com/developers) - Official resources for developers building on Solana.

## Core Concepts

Explanation of fundamental concepts in the Solana ecosystem:

- [Understanding Slots, Blocks, and Epochs on Solana](https://www.helius.dev/blog/solana-slots-blocks-and-epochs) - How Solana slots, blocks, and epochs work together.
- [Consensus on Solana](https://www.helius.dev/blog/consensus-on-solana) - How Solana PoH works.

## Development Tools

Key tools and environments for Solana:

- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) - A framework for Solana's Sealevel runtime providing several convenient developer tools.
- [@solana/web3.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/web3.js) - Solana JavaScript API for interacting with Solana nodes.

## Smart Contracts

How to write and deploy smart contracts on Solana:

- [An Introduction to Anchor](https://www.helius.dev/blog/an-introduction-to-anchor-a-beginners-guide-to-building-solana-programs) - How to build on Solana with Anchor.

Solana supports native programs written in Rust. Additionally, some Solana projects support EVM compatibility, allowing for Solidity smart contracts.

## Solana Network

Going into the network level:

- [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/) - Solana Explorer.
- [Solscan](https://solscan.io/) - Solana explorer with better UI/UX.

## Ecosystem Projects

Cool projects built on Solana:

- [Helius](https://www.helius.dev/) - Infra for Solana developers.
- [Magic Eden](https://magiceden.io/) - NFT Marketplace
- [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) - Mint NFTs on Solana

## Resources

## Handy Code Snippets

Get a taste of Solana development with these code snippets:

### Connecting to Solana

```javascript
const { Connection, clusterApiUrl } = require('@solana/web3.js');

const connection = new Connection(clusterApiUrl('devnet'), 'confirmed');
console.log(`Connected to Solana ${connection.rpcEndpoint}`);
```

### Creating a new account

```javascript
const { Keypair } = require('@solana/web3.js');

const newAccount = Keypair.generate();
console.log('Public Key:', newAccount.publicKey.toString());
```

These examples showcase:
1. How to connect to the Solana network.
2. How to create a new Solana account.
